3. Arduino Tutorial
===================

3.1 Data download
-----------------

Arduino information contains library files and project code ,please
click to download for follow-up study.

Data download: :download:`Arduino <./Arduino.7z>`

3.2 Software Download
---------------------

Open the browser and search: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software, we will
take WINDOWS system as an example to show you how to download and
install.

3.4 Add Library
---------------

Open the Arduino IDE, follow [Sketch] → [Include Library] → [Add .zip
Library]. This method can only import one library file at a time. If the
product has multiple libraries, please import them one by one following
this process!

**GET STARTED WITH CIRCUIT PROJECTS!**

There are 21 circuit projects total. Each project will introduce new
concepts and components, which will be described in more detail as you
progress through the circuits.

As you work your way through each circuit, you will learn to use new and
more complicated parts to accomplish increasingly complex tasks.

The project will set the foundation for the rest and will aid in helping
you understand the fundamentals of circuit building and electricity!

**GET STARTED WITH ROBOT PROJECTS!**

|image5|

In this project, you will learn all about DC motors and motor drivers by
building your own robot!You’ll first learn motor control basics. By
adding an IR receiver, remote control the robot to move freely. By
adding an IR receiver or distance sensor, the robot can learn how to
avoid obstacles.

**Please follow the installation guide for the car as shown in the
picture below. After completing the installation, continue studying from
Project 22 to Project 26.**
