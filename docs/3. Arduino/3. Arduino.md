## 3.5 Project

**GET STARTED WITH CIRCUIT PROJECTS!**

There are 21 circuit projects total. Each project will introduce new concepts and components, which will be described in more detail as you progress through the circuits.

As you work your way through each circuit, you will learn to use new and more complicated parts to accomplish increasingly complex tasks.

The project will set the foundation for the rest and will aid in helping you understand the fundamentals of circuit building and electricity!



**GET STARTED WITH ROBOT PROJECTS!**

In this project, you will learn all about DC motors and motor drivers by building your own robot!You’ll first learn motor control basics. By adding an IR receiver, remote control the robot to move freely. By adding an IR receiver or distance sensor, the robot can learn how to avoid obstacles.

**<font color="red">Please follow the installation guide for the car as shown in the picture below. After completing the installation, continue studying from Project 22 to Project 26.</font>**
